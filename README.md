Don't forget to use the SSH url when cloning it/adding the remote origin to a folder

Important rules when working on this repository:

1. When commiting a modification please add the name of the file that was changed.

2. Before starting to work on a code pull all the code, so as to avoid re-doing the same work.

3. Let's try to have each one of us working on different classes. It will happen that we will need to work on the same code at some point, but it will reduce the amount of modification that we would need to do per code.

4. **Don't touch the model classes.**
